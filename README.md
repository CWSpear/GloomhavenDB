# Gloomhaven DB

Future site of Gloomhaven DB.

I have 3 main goals with this site:

1st goal: I want this to be a collection of all the "data" in Gloomhaven in a more "machine-readable" format. The main point of this would be for developers to have a centralized API to get data for apps/tools they might want to use. For example, that guy that recently created that item viewer thing on Reddit had to scrape all the data himself and manually review it all, which takes a lot of time. I want to stop that part of it so people like him can focus on just building the tools.

The 2nd goal would be to create a centralized reference for the community. A place that you can point to show of specific items, battle goals, event cards, etc. Think like the Item Wiki here on the Subreddit, but more centralized (and since we're not limited by the Wiki styles, better looking).

The 3rd goal, off in the future, would be to provide tools for things like writing and sharing guides, commenting on cards and perhaps even a "card builder" tool to be able to create custom cards (events, battle goals, ability cards, items, etc) to make it easier to create custom classes, etc.

Uses https://github.com/any2cards/gloomhaven for images (tho many have been modified).
