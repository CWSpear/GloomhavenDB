You are shopping for supplies
in the Boilers District when an
intense explosion knocks you off your
feet
You look in the direction of the heat waves
to see plumes of fire and smoke rising from a
building less than a block a way,
The fire rages uncontrollably and there arc
many wounded residents laying near the blast,
screaming in pain.
You also spot something else — a hooded figure
in a dark robe fleeing from the scene.
Option A; Rush to the aid of the residents and
help put out the fire.

Option B: Pursue the hooded figure and make
him answer for this attack.
