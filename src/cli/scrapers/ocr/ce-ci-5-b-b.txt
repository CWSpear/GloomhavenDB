OTHERWISE: It is easy enough to follow the
Valrath as he walks to the west. The day is
ending and the streets are crowded. Eventually
he turns into a large warehouse, and you move
to keep up.
You are surprised, however, to run into a guard
at the warehouse entrance. You try to act like
you belong here, but he is not buying it. Only
after paying him off with a considerable sum
does he let you inside.
Lose 10 collective gold.
