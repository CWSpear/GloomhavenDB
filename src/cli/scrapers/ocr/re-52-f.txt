You smell the corpses before
you see them, A group of five or so,
spread across the road, flies buzzing around in
a frenzy.
4s you get closer, you see the wretched, deformed
looks on their faces and the boils covering their
skin, You also see their crude armor and weapons
likely a group of cutthroats.
What is truly odd’ though, is that their weapons
are out of their sheaths in the first place. It appears
they went* engaged in battle when they suddenly
succumbed to some horrible disease.
You can think of at least one way that could have
happened. Fine handiwork from the Plagueherald,
