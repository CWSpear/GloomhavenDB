A curious invitation is slipped
under your door in the early
morning. It is for a wedding ceremony
between the children of two wealthy
Gloomhaven merchants. Your exploits seem
to have placed you in their good graces, and
so they would like you to join them on this
special occasion, provided you don't show up
in hlood-soaked armor.
And for the love of the Great Oak, bring a gift.
Option A: Attend the wedding with an expensive
gift.
Option B: Attend the wedding and bring a
mundane gift.
