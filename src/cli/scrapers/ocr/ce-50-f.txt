“A monstrous creature ap-
proaches the walls!" A guard with
a truly terrified look runs toward you,
waving his arms with manic energy.
"Please! You must help!" Before you can even
agree, he grabs you by the wrist and pulls you
toward the East Gate.
You hear the beast before you see it, bellowing
with rage and pounding at the gates. Each time
it hits, the entire city shakes. You climb the
ramparts and look down at the massive creature
with six legs as thick as trees, two spiraling
horns, and a spiked tail.
This is truly a demon horn the abyss, ' the guard
laments. It must be from another plane, so he's
not too far off.
Option A: Attack the beast from the wall,
shooting arrows at it until it stops moving.
Option B: Work on reinforcing the walls. I lold it
off for as long as possible.
