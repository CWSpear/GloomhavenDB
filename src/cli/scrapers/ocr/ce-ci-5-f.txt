¥ Your name is A files. You ve
been a guard in White Oak lor a
few years now, trying to support your
new family When councilman Wind mere
went missing and orders came down from
the Guild not to investigate, that was weird.
And then when your friend Roger made a big
slink about it, and suddenly he went missing
toot well, you know when it $ bet ter Just to keep
your head down and not get involvedl
At the morning rundown, you were told to be on
the lookout lor a group that escaped the Mouth
of Antiquity You asked what they were thrown
in there lor, but the captain didn't seem to think
that was important. Still, the escapees are now
in front of you, dirty and beaten, rambling about
how they were framed and the Valrath tied up
next to them is the real culprit.
Option A: Arrest them all and bring them to your
captain.
Option B: Get involved and try to figure out what
is going on.
