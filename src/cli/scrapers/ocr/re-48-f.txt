You see them long before they
get close to you radiant balls ol light
blazing against the horizon.
Sun Demons,
As they approach, you prepare for an attackr but the
demons have other plans. They menace you with
their glowing clawsr but they would rather have
information than kill you.
"Where is the one you call a Sunkeeper?" one ol
them hisses. ' The Valrath neglects her duties, and
now we must resolve matters personally *
You press for further information, but the demons
get angry *These are not your concerns! Tell us
where she is or die at our hands!'
Option A: Give them whatever information you
can on the Sunkeepers whereabouts.
Option B: Attack the demons. There are a lot of
them, but you do not take kindly to threats.
