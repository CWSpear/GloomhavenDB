You are trudging through some
foothills when you hear the strongest
sound in the distance. It sounds vaguely like
wolves howling, but higher pitched, and there is a
rhythm and a melody to it,
You crest a nearby hill and survey the area, spying a
pack ofVermUngs standing in a circle and singing.
"Singing'T is the best way you can think to describe
it, anyway Occasionally during the song they also
clap and dance around.
Option A: The song must serve some nefarious
purpose. Attack the Vermlings.
Option B: Move closer and enjoy the music.
