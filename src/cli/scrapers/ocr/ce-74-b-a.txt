You enter a smaller tent off the main one and
come face-to-face with what is indeed a danc-
ing bear. Its handler stands to the side, prod-
ding it on occasion, while the bear stands on
its hind two legs and shuffles back and forth.
It is amusing until the handler prods the bear
one too many times and the bear becomes
enraged and attacks. You quickly jump into
action and subdue the bear, saving the han-
dler from getting mauled to death.
