You move farther into the
desolate tunnel and slowly realize
y
you are in a waste disposal network
lor the prison. There is a concavity to the
floors and a slight downward slope. And, as
you progress, you find all manner of awful
things dumped from unreachable holes in the
ceiling: txcremeni, rotten food, and decaying
corpses are the most prevalent items.
The air grows dense with absolute foulnesst but
still you persist forward until you come to an
intersection where your tunnel converges with
another Looking down the other path, you see
it slopes upward a way from you, but you are also
hit with a wave of even more nauseating stench,
in the other direction, the tunnel opens up into
a natural cavern, with the river of filth spilling
out into the open air like a vile waterfall[ You do,
however; sec a trechcrous path of rocks along one
side of the cavern accessible from where you arc.
Option A: Cuter the upward-sloping tunnel.
Option B: Climb up into the natural cavern*
