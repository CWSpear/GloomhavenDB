You flatly refuse to pay off the Sawbones'
debt and convince him the only way to escape
his pursuers is to board a ship bound for the
eastern continent, far out of their reach. He
is reluctant but eventually agrees when you
remind him what unknown adventures await
in the land across the ocean. You see him off
in the night and desperately hope that is the
last you hear of this situation.
Add City Event 67 to the deck.
