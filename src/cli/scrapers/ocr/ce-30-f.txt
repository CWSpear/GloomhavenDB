■4s you shop for supplies at
the Sinking Market, your hand
instinctively goes for the purse at vour
waist.
It s gone!

Verm ling darting a way from you, heading
directly toward a sewer grating.
Option A: Give chase! No one steals from you and
gets away with it.
Option B: lake a clear shot at him with a bow
before he disappears into the grating.
