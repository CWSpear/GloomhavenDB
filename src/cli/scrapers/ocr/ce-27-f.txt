You are out in the Ward of
Scales when you sec a crowd of
people forming to the south, growing
louder and more dense hv the second.
*
As you approach, you sec through the angry
mob a terrified Vermfing being pulled in your
direction by a group of gruff men,
"Dirty thief!' a woman next to you screams.
“String it up!’
Glancing behind you to where the crowd appears
to be headed, you see a disused gibbet in the
market square.
The men — clearly not guards — move closer.
Option A: Attempt to stop the crowd from
hanging the Vermling,
Option B: lake no action and see this through to
its logical conclusion.
