: You push your way to the front
of the mob and stop the men as they enter
the store. Clearly emotions have gotten
the better of these people. Through a calm
demeanor, you are able to talk the mob down.
A sense of relief washes over the crowd.
Gain I reputation.
OTHERWISE: You kindly entreat the crowd
to back down. It gets a little rough, but it
becomes clear the crowd isn't fully into
it. After knocking a few heads, the mob
disperses.
No effect.
