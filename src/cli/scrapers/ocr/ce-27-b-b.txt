) ou watch as the men move past you toward
the gibbet. One carries a thick rope that
• he ties around the Vermling 's neck. The
other end of the rope is thrown over the
cross beam and then the men begin pulling,
hoisting the helpless thief up off his feet. He

but eventually he stops moving. The men tie
off the rope, leaving the lifeless thief hanging.
People begin to mill about, many stopping to
spit on the ground before returning to work.
