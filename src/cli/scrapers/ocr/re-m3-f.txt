You moke your preparations,
and Drey! assures you she will be safe
on the beach, so you head hack into the dense
forest toward the center of the island.
You move more carefully this time now that no
one ’s life is on the line. You creep through the brush,
making sure that nothing is alerted of your advance.
The strange chanting sound gets ever louder.
After an hour; you begin to see signs of a clearing
up ahead[ and you can almost make out a large stone
structure though the foliage. Suddenly; however,
your attention is drawn to movement off to your
right. You see an odd streak of color as a small,
brightly dressed Vermling scout runs a way from
you toward the denser forest. No doubt it saw you
and is going to alert others of your presence.
Option A: Ignore the Vermling and continue
toward the stone structure*
Option B: Chase after the Vermling to make sure
our presence remains hidden.
