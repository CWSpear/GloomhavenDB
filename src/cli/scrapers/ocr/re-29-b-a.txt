^: The Craghearts combination of raw
strength and an affinity for stonework is
perfect for this task. In a matter of minutes,
enough stones have been destroyed or
thrown aside to open a path.
No effect.
OTHERWISE: The situation is not ideal, but
you work through the pain. By the time a
path has been cleared away, you never want
to see another rock in your life.
Discard 2 cards each.
