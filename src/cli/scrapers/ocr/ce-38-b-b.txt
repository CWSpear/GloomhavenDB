# <p ; After a good beating, the crowd is
riled up. Many people start looking in your
direction, muttering about how you have the
nerve to associate with Orchids as well. You
make a quick exit.
Lose I reputation.
OTHERWISE: The Orchid puts up no defense
and the "fight "becomes rather one-sided. A
solid beating is administered, and the crowd
is sated. You go about your business while the
Orchid bleeds on the ground.
No effect.
