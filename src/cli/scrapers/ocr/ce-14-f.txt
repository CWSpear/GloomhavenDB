You hear screams from the
south as you approach the docks
and see a group of women running
toward you in a panic.
"An invasion! They veil as they race by you,
nearly knocking you over
You hurry to the docks and find a crowd
of workers on edge, armed with makeshift
weapons and circling one particular pier.
Standing at the far end of the wooden planks
is a group of Lurkers — terrifying crab-like
monsters as big as an Inox and equally ferocious.
Except these Lurkers don't appear to be hostile.
They are simply standing on the dock, clacking
their claws in a strange rhythm.
Option A: Raise arms and fight the Lurkers back
into the sea.
Option B: Approach the Lurkers cautiously and
attempt to communicate with them.
