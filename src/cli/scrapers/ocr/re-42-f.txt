At the sight of you, the Brute lights up and gives
you a big wave, then rushes over to greet you. He
is positively joyful to see you and immediately
starts to reminisce about all the exciting battles you
fought together
Slapping you on the back, he implores you to travel
with the caravan fora while to give you all a chance
to catch up.
