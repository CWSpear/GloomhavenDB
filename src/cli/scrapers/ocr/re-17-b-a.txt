You set the wings and bang out a few dents
while the Quatryl repairs his pressure
problem. In under an hour, the Quatryl
declares the contraption airworthy and
jumps in the cockpit. You stand clear and
watch in awe as the thing begins flapping
wildly, then sputters forward and lifts off the
ground.
Unfortunately, the /light is short-lived, and
the second crash is not nearly as forgiving.
You find the Quatryl dead on impact, and
there's nothing more to do except harvest the
machine for valuable parts.
