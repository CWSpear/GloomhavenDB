You enter the battle to aid the Berserker, but
in her blood rage, she can't distinguish ftriend
from foe. She begins hacking away at you
with her axe as much as she swings at the
guards. You concentrate on taking out the
remaining guards, but when you turn back
to the Berserker, she seems to have vanished
into the nearby forest.
All start scenario with 3 damage.
