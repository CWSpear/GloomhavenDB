As you walk through some
foothills, the ground suddenly shakes
violently beneath you. Two massive demons
built of earth and stone rise up in front of you,
Today we shall feast on your flesh, foolish travelers!m
fust as the demons take a step toward you, a massive
ball of fire streaks through the air from behind and
connects squarely with one of the demons, which
erupts into a pillar of flame. Then lightning streaks
toward the other, destroying one of its arms.
Looking around, you see the old Savvas you met
earlier, who continues to throw out powerful
attacks until the demons are forced to retreat,
“Well, fancy meeting you again!*
Option A: Thank the Savvas for his timely
assistance.
Option B: Admonish the Savvas, claiming you
could have handled the demons without his help.
