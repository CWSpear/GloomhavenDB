You hide behind some barrels and wait for
the thieves to return. It takes the rest of
the night, but just as you are about to give

enough to get the drop on them, overpower
them, and deliver them to the authorities.
When you return the stolen artifacts to the
sanctuary, the priest is incredibly pleased
with your work.
