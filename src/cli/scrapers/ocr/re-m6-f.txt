It takes a tremendous amount
of effort and vigilance, keeping an eye
on both DreyI and Barty all hours of the day
and night. It seems to work for the first few days...
In the afternoon of the
day sailing east,
however, as you are sitting in the cabin for a meal\
eyeing each other silently Drey! starts to cough and
retch. It grows more violent until she is kneeling on
the floor heaving up blood[ You try to aid hen but
nothing you do seems to help, and within moments,
she makes one last gurgle and collapses to the
groundl
Dreyl is dead. You look up at Barty who stands over
her with an expression of smug satisfaction.
'Oh, come now. It was always going to be me or her I
tried to warn you of that, but you refused to choose.
So I did the choosin' for us all. You re welcome."
Option A: Accept the situation tor what it is and
continue sailing with Barty.
Option B: t ake out Barty bef ore he poisons you too.
