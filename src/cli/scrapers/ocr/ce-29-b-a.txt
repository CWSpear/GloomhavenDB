The workers' hard expressions
soften a bit when they see a Savvas among
you. You talk for a while and explain that they
need the city just as much as the city needs
them. In the end. you sell them on a smaller
wage increase, and everyone returns to work.
Gain I prosperity.
OTHERWISE: Even after much effort, the
workers won't speak to you at all, calling you
part of the problem. The strike is eventually
resolved, but no one seems happy.
No effect.
