It was a truly marvelous night,
full of alcohol and fuzzy memories.
You are heading hack to your rooms in
high spirits when you take a wrong turn
into an alley and trip over a mutilated corpse,
'What '$ all thisr then? You look up to see a city
guard walk into the alley; annoyed by all the
noise you were making in your revelry
Before you can react, he draws his sword. "You...
what did you do?”
You look and see that, due to the fall your clothes
are now covered in blood. The guard clearly
thinks you are responsible for the man s death,
This night just took a serious turn for the worse,
Option A: Do your best to explain that the man
was like this when you found him.
Option B: Panic and kill the guard, then dispose
of both corpses.
