The crowd ports os you opprooch the dock
with weapons drown. You step onto the soft
wood ond the Lurkers turn toward you and
stop clocking. They oil hiss ond brandish their
clows in aggression. You charge forward ond
meet the threat head-on, hacking away at
their carapaces until they scuttle off the dock
ond back into the water.
