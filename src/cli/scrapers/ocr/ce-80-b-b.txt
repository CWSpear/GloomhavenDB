Seeing the situation turning south, you waste
no time pulling your weapons and prepare
for an attack. The guards are more than
happy to oblige.
Luckily vour foes sustain only some minor
injuries in the time it takes for another squad
of guards to arrive and break up the scuffle.
They let you go on your wayf but you can see
the disdain in all of their eves.
