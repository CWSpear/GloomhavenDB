Riding
on
grand
experience of flight, you throw caution
to the wind and fly east out toward the open seaf
leaving behind the crumbling waste of the islandl
It is exhilarating and wonderful and everything
you hoped it would be, up until the point where
your feathers begin to fall out and you find youself
plummeting toward the vast, empty ocean.
The landing is harshr but staying afloat becomes
even harsher as the hours roll by, the sun drops low,
and you see dark clouds on the horizon, Luckily, as
the desperation sets in, you also see a small ship
with tattered sails approaching you. With the last
of your energy, you yell and splash your arms. In a
matter of minutes, you have been rescued, dragged
onto the deck of a rickety; makeshift boat and come
face-to-face with none other than Barty Half-Ear.
Option A: Attack Barty. Dreyl’s vengeance must be
exacted.
Option B: Make peace with Barty. Without his
expertise, you don't like your chances in the coming
torm.
