As you crest a hill, you see a
flock of carrion birds scatter to the east.
They must have been feasting on something, so
you decide to investigate.
After a short walk, you come upon a mans corpse,
badly decayed and mangled, lying in the dirt« His
face is a bloody messf but you do see a distinctive
chain around his neck and recall the description the
man from the Sleeping Lion gave you of his brother:
This is very likely him.
Option A: Bury the man and bring the chain back
to his brother.
Option B: Take the chain for yourself and don't
tell the brother.
