Late in the evening, you are
returning to your rooms when
you hear a cry for help coming from a
nearby alleyway. Racing into the shadows,
you expect to find someone in distress, but
instead find a group of men clad in black
leather armor eying you maliciously.
‘ We have a message lor your Nightshroud
friend, " one of them says, drawing a wicked
looking curved blade. Suddenly, the Nightshroud
appears among them in a flash of fatal sword
strikes. Before the men even have a chance to
react, hall of them lie dead on the ground. The
other half quickly flee.
‘‘Well, it looks like you're into it now, too. Which
is good, because I need help taking them down."
Option A: Stay and listen to what the Nightshroud
has to say.
Option B: Claim you want nothing to do with this
and walk away.
