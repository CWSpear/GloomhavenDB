Criminals deserve freedom as much as the
next man. While the guards arc distracted
by the one escapee, you rush to the wagon
and release the others. Chaos erupts as the
prisoners scatter in every direction. Many
manage to escape, and you find a mysterious
gift of thanks waiting on your doorstep when
you return to Cloomhaven.
