You encounter two Valraths
with a small horse and cart on the side
of the road. They seem a little uncomfortable at
your approach, their hands instinctively going for
their weapons.
You make a sign of peace and they relax a little.
M Perhaps it is good that you happen by, travelers, "
the one on the left says. "Our horse is completely
spent and we fare little better. We are in desperate
need ofsome supplies to finish our journey.'
The Valrath offers a crude smile. uDo you think you
could help us in this matter?'
Option A: Give the Valraths a portion of your
supplies.
Option B: You spent good money on these
supplies. Refuse to help.
