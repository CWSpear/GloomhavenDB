Finding it probable that these corpses harbor
some sort of disease, you ward c veryone
away while you carefully load the bodies onto
a cart, take them outside the city, and burn
them.
The crowd is a little disappointed that you
took away the morning entertainment.
Especially annoyed are the guards, who don l
appreciate you disposing of dead bodies
before they can investigate them.
Lose I reputation.
