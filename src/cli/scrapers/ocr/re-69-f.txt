Walking a long*the trail, you are
surprised by a group of demons who
appear to your left, charging over a hill toward
you. Something is off however. Their pace is slow,
and they are significantly smaller than the demons
you normally deal with.
Hallway down the hill, the demons pause and take
stock of you. Seeing you are far from easy prey, they
turn around and begin to retreat.

Option A: Chase them down quickly and kill
them.
Option B: Follow them more slowly, attempting
to discover where they came from.
