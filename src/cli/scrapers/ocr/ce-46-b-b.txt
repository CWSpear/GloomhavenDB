,\'ot fitting in with its own kind or with
d city of mostly humans, the C ragheart
thought it could depend on a misfit group of
mercenaries for friendship. It understands
(hat its adventuring life is now in the past,
though, and that it should go find a new place
to belong. It sadly admits that it has no idea
where that would be, but the Cragheart gets
up and leaves the tavern nonetheless.
No effect.
