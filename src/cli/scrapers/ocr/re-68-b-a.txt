Ihe merchant remains dead silent as you sift
through his cart and pull out any valuables.
There's not a whole lot in his wares, but the
ease in which you are able to take what he
has makes it all the sweeter.
Once you are finished, you continue on your
way and he continues on his.
Gain 10 gold each.
