You return to your rooms for
the evening to find a small note
resting on the ground in front of vour
door.
It is from the Tinkerer, explaining that he has
been pursuing further studies in flammable
liquid delivery methods. He asks for your help
in delivering to him a small robotic contraption
that he absentmindedlv left behind in a secret
stash under the floorboards of his old room.
He details the device’s location and gives an
address to deliver it to some small village far
to the northwest.
»
Option A: Oblige the Tinkerer and send along the
contraption
■
Option B: You don't want to pay for postage.
Just keep the thing for yourself.
