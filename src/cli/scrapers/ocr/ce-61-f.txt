The day proves uneventful
until you head back to your room
in the evening to find a small package
waiting at your doorstep. Resting on it is
another note from the Tinkerer:
He thanks you profusely for sending along
the mechanical spider, saying it was a great
help in his work. He doesn t need it any longer,
however and decided to send it hack.
He explains that he made a few improvements to
it as well while it was in his possession, and that it
should help you significantly in your adventures.
Option A: Gratefully keep the spider*
Option B: You can t decide who should keep itr
so sell the spider and split the money.
