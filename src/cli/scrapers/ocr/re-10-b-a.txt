You tie one of your weapons to a long rope
and manage to hook it onto a sturdy tree root
hanging over the pit. With enough effort,
you are able to extricate yourself from the
pit and get as far away as possible before
the situation gets worse. You suffered some
minor scrapes and bruises in the fall[ but you
count yourself lucky.
All start scenario with 1 damage.
