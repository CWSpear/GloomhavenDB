You see smoke on the horizon
expecting the worst♦ Sure
enough, you approach the scene to
ransacked caravan	burned\ pillaged, and
stroyed by what appears to be Vermlings.

laments that when the Vermlings came upon them,
one of the guards, a large Inox. seemed to throw
aside his weapon and simply accept his fate.

bloody among the wreckage. Seeing him this way;
the fire gone from his eyes, he appears unnaturally
small
