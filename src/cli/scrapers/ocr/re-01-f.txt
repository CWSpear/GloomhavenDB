*7hading out a little late, aren't
you? The guard at the wall looks at
you passively. You grunt in response and head
through the opened gate,
"Nobody s gonna go looking Tor your corpse ifyou
don't returnf* the guard shouts at your back.
You ended up embarking out on the road much
later than you had hoped events in town saw to
that — but as dusk settles on the horizon you feel
confident that you are up to any threat you might
face.

foul beasts — and, judging from their sounds, they
seem to be getting closer.
Option A: Run from the howling to safety.
Option B: Let the wolves come.
