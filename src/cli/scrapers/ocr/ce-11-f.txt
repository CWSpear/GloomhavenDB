You can see the parchment has the designs for
something on it, but still — you recognize this
Harrower. It is known for trading in disreputable
goods. You can t know where that parchment
came iromf and if anyone saw you dealing with
this creature...well, they might get the wrong
idea.
Option A: Make a deal wilh the Harrower.
Option B: Shake your head and walk away. Best
not to take chances in such situations.
