As you return to town after
your latest adventure, you see
5/770Ac rising from the walls of the city:
You enter the broken gates and see a scene
of despair as the citizens of Gloomhaven
recover from a catastrophic attack.
'Demons, a wounded guard at the gate savs.
"Wish you lot could have been around to help
fight them off Now look at the place, Luckily the
rest of the city remained safe.'
Option A; Attempt to console and cheer up those
affected by the attack.
Option B: Help repair the gate. You wouldn’t
want another attack to further cripple the town.
