fay are wandering through an
abysmal tog, cursing the very tact you
woke up this morningYou cant see two feet
in front of your face and everything is just so cot
and damp.
Walking down what you think is the road, you nearfy
bump into an elderly Savvas.
”Ah, how fortuitous is such a meeting," the Savvas
says. *You look like the ones whom my protege
worked with for some time. Normally I would not
give the lesser races a second glance, but the master
of elements must have seen something in you."
It stretches its joints and looks around. 7 lmmr you
must be having a rough time with this weather I
could offer you something that may help.*
Option A: Accept the gift of the Savvas.
Option B: Downplay your struggle and politely
decline the Savvass offer.
