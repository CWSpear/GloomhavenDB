There
was a
heavy rain HH
night, and the roads are now dark streaks
of mud. And as bad as it is for you walking, you
see that others up ahead on the road are having
worse trouble. You come upon a collection of
wagons stuck in the mud on the side of the road.
You look around and see an odd assortment
of people dressed in garish clothing. They are
working to push their brightly painted wagons, all
emblazoned with a Marvelous and Magical Techno-
Circus " logo, out of the muck.
We just stopped for a quick meal, and now the
wheels have sunk into this mess/ a Qua try I with
a fancy top hat says as you approach. "I'm sure
our strongmen will get us out eventually but we
certainly wouldn't begrudge a little extra help."
Option A: Help push out the Quatryl ringmasters
wagon.
Option B: Help push out the fortune-tellers
wagon.
