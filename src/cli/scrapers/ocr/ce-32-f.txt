As vou return to town after
*
your latest adventure, a high-
ranking guard approaches and gestures
you to the side of the road.
7 am embarrassed to admit this," he begins
in a low voice, "but we could really use some
help. With all the attacks recently and very
little support from the capital the city guard
finds itself woefully lacking in both equipment
and training for the new recruits."
The guard looks you over. You are experienced
warriors, and anything you could do to help the
situation would be greatly appreciatedl
Option A: Agree to help the city guard.
Option B: Decline to help and instead sell this
information to interested parties.
