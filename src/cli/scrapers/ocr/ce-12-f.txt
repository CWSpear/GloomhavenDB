A great revelry is underway at
the New Market when you arrive
to purchase supplies. Investigating
further, vou discover the town is in the
-
midst of a pie-eating contest.
A group of large sailors sits triumphantly at
a long table on a makeshift stage, crumbs and
bits of fruit scattered all around. A man in the
center stands and addresses the crowd[
'Can no one best our pie-eating prowess? Step
up and test your mettle!" With nothing better to
do, you head up to the stage.
The contest goes well fora while as you match the
others pie-for-pie, but soon your eating starts to
slow; and the sailors are still going strong.
Option A: Yield to the pie and admit defeat.
Option B: Power through the pain. You will not
be bested!
