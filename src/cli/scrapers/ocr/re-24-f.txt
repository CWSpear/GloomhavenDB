come a cross a group of
brow-beaten Inox trudging down the
path in the opposite direct ion as you. Some are
pulling carts laden with various miscellany, mostly
Furs and crudely crafted goods. The rest have
armloads of much of the same.
It is obvious that this is everything the Inox have —
their life 's worth in their arms and wagons* They are
all covered in what appears to be soot.
The shaman at the head of the group calls to you*
The beast awakens! The mountain is aflame!
Beware you do not anger it!"
Looking to the horizon, you can see black smoke
rising from a far-off peak.
Option A: Aid the Inox with what they arc
carrying.
Option B: Ignore the Shamans ramblings.
