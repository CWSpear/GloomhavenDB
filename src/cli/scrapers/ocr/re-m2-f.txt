It is difficult to keep your footing as
the ship shudders and lists, slowly breaking
apart at the seams. One of you swims through the
lower part of the ship in a search of Drey! while the rest
head out to the deck looking for a dinghy Barty is left to
drown in his wooden coffin.
You manage to find both things you arc looking for but
Drey! is face down in the water, badly burnt and not
breathing. You puff her clear of the wreckage and get her
on board the small lifeboat. One of you begins pumping
her chest and blowing air into her mouth, while another,
unconcerned for her fate, jumps back into the water to
salvage some machinery from Dreyl s ruined ship.
You get Dreyl to breathe again, weakly coughing up lungfuls
ot water: Your other party member returns with only some
basic tools and gears, and then you r<nv toward the island
on the horizon. As it gets closer, you see it is much larger
than your initial expectations. The side facing you is lined
with dangerous crags, but there appears to be an opening
to a cave in the sheer dill side.

Option A: Continue around the perimeter of the island,
looking for a safer place to land and properly take care of
Dreyl.
Option B; A dangerous cave! Adventure! Who cares about
helping Dreyl recover from her injuries?
