You wake in the middle of
the night to the sound of rushing
water. In the corner ofyour room, you
sec a flood gushing out of the head of the
Summoner's staff which you had previously
picked up in your travels.
You jump out of bed and splash through a
growing puddle of water to investigate the
staff, hut you can't make any sense of it. ft
seems to he materializing the water out of thin
air, possibly channeling it from another plane of
existence. You scratch your head, unsure of what
to do next.
Option A: Kind some way to get the water to stop
gushing.
Option B; Gel the stall out ot your room and
throw it into the bay.
