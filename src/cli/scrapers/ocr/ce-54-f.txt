Posters spring up in town
announcing the performance of a
master Quatrvl musician and her merry
hand of performers. Looking closely at the
image, you re pretty sure you recognize that
foppish feathered hat.
The poster says the next show is tonight. You
decide to attend for one purpose or another.
Option A: Go to the show and cheer on the
Soothsinger.
Option B: Seems like a good opportunity to pick
some pockets while people are distracted.
