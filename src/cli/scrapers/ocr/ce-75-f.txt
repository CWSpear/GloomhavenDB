Returning to Gloomhaven af-
ter your latest outing, you are ap-
proached by the Captain of the Guard
at the city gates.
“Ah, I was hoping I might catch you here soon-
er or later," he says. 7 have still been receiving
reports about large, flying lizards from the
scouts. Tell me, have you gotten to the bottom
of that situation yet?"
Option A: Lie and say that you are still working
on it.
Option B: Tell the Captain you decided not to kill
the Elder Drake.
