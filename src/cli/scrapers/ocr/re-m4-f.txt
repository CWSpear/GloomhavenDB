You watch as the Hollowbone
tribe finishes their fcjst and takes flight.
From the air, Antgut caws at you happily in
thanks. You stuff your packs full of the strange meat
and then resume your trek toward the stone structure
farther inland.
ft takes you a while to backtrack and find it, but the
constant sound of chanting pulls you back to the
clearing; where you get a better view of the temple. It
is a towering building with a massive pyramid base and
a multi-tiered spire above it. You cannot fathom how
it was built, but feel confident the Verm lings did not
do so on their own. It feels ancient and ominous. The
chanting permeates the areaf but you can t tell where
it is coming from.
You carefully approach through the clearing, noticing
some vague movement from the upper tiers of the spire.
When you arrive at the base, you find a set of stairs
carved into the surface of the stone leading upward.
You also see an ornate openning to the pyramid and a
set of stairs leading down into its depths.
Option A: lake the stairs upward toward the spire.
tion R: Descend into the darkness of the pyramid.
