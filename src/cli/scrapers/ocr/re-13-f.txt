Traveling off the beaten path,
you arc surprised to see a large group
ol figures on the horizon. You take out your
weapons and move cautiously forward.
As you get closer; it becomes clear that the figures
are not aliver but sculptures of some kind\ made
haphazardly out of branches, garbage, and scrap
metal There are fifty or so in the middle of a field,
with no other signs of life as far as you can see.
You see a necklace that may be valuable on one of
them and go to grab it.
"Don't touch her!" You wheel around to see an old
man in rags emerge from a hole in the ground and
charge at you with a broken broom handle. "These
women arc all mine!"
