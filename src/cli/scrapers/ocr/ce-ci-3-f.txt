After the fight with the oozes
and other creatures, your journey
through the tunnels deeper into the
cavern becomes relatively easy. There are
y	y
no difficult climbs or unstable footing —just
a narrow; rocky path that winds ever upward.
You begin to suspect the route was at least
partially man-made, and it takes a few hours,
but eventually you find further evidence of (his
suspicion — the sound of voices coming from
ahead of you. Moving quietly lorwardf you hear
the voices get steadily louder until you make out
a handful of words, like “merchants,” 'trade/ and
*Gloomhaven."
You peer around a rock and sec two robed men
standing and talking in a cellar of some sortt
with a set of stairs to the left leading up into a
wooden ceiling, You also notice a patch on one of
the men s sleeves: a skull with a sword t hrough it.
