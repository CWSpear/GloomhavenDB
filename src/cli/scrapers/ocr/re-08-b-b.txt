Unfa zed by the ambush, you draw your
weapons and attack the bandits in the
bushes. The leader tries to withdraw, but
you cut him down as well. There are a lot of
bandits, but they don t put up too much of
a fight. They seem weak and malnourished.
You guess the leader wasn 't kidding about
needing to buy food.
All start scenario with 3 damage.
