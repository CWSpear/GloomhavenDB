Walking near Gloomhaven
Square, you see a peculiar scene.
A group of guards is dragging along
a VermUng in tattered robes toward the
Ghost Fortress. Getting a little closer, you
recognise the Mindthicf,
"Hssss," she spits. *'Why do you do this? I
came to you! I tell you that this town is being
poisoned, and you respond by imprisoning me?"
“Well sec what the Captain of the Guard has to
say about this," one of her captors says. “Keep
moving!"
Option A: Intervene with the guards and find out
what is going on.
Option B: Let the guards continue their
business and just continue with yours.
