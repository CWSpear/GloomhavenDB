You head back to your rooms
for the night when you see the
Sawbones sitting in front of your
doorstep, looking rather dejected.
7, uh, well, you see...” he stammers, 7
followed your advice. Chased my dreams and
all that, but I ended up in debt to some rather
unscrupulous people, fhey 've threatened to kill
me if I don t pay them off\ but, uh, but I simply
don t have the money ”
He hesitates. Seeing as how, uh, you bear some
responsibility for setting me down this path, I
was wondering if you d be willing to offer some
assistance in getting me out of this mess?'
Option A: Offer to pay off the Sawbones' debt.
Option B: Get the Sawbones on a boat across the
Misty Sea. New adventures surely await there.
