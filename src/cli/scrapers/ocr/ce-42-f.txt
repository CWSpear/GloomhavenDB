Walking near the West Gate,
you are approached by a scrawny
kid in a guard uniform, which is dearly
too big for his small frame.
"Hey, you all are famous! " he says with a big
smile. "I worked as a caravan guard before I
got this job. Met with a big Inox guv who
always talked about you. He made you seem like
the nicest, most amazing people."
His smile and excitement doesn’t waver. "Say,
mv detail is doing some work to repair the wall
damage from the last Vcrmling attack. Would
you mind helping us! It 'll be fun!"
Option A: Agree to help the presumptuous kid.
Option B: Tell this kid that he must have the
wrong group of adventurers.
