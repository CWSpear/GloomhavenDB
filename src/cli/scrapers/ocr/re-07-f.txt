Walking along
•? Forest, you begin to hear strange,
unfamiliar sounds coming from beyond the
trees; You stop and listen closer.

There's a rhythm to the sounds, and with that
established\ you begin to pick out different human
voices in the mix. You'd venture to say that the noise
vaguely sounds like chanting.
Option A: Head into the forest to investigate the
chanting.
Option B: Keep moving on down the road. No
eed to get mixed up in whatever is going on.
