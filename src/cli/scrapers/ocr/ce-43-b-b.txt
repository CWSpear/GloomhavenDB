Like an eager treasure hunter, you pry up the
floorboards in the Tinkcrers old room and
find a trove of useless junk, plus a detailed
robotic spider that is anything but useless.
You switch it on and let it scurry around
the room. This could be a significant help in
battle. No way its getting shipped off.
