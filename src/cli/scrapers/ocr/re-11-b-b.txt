f Vbu jump under an
outcropping/but something is not right.
Those among you attuned to the elements
turn towardthe face of the mountain and
step into it, as though the rocks were gone,
Inside, you see an odd crystal jutting out of
the earth. Vbu snatch it upt and the tremors
stop.
Add City Event 73 to the deck.
OTHERWISE: The outcropping proves to
be an unstable place to hide. You are quickly
buried in rubble.
All start scenario with 4 damage.
