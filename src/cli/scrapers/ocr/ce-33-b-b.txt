Unable to resist, you watch to see what will
happen to the girl. Her skin turns ashen and
begins to flake away. She stops screaming
eventually and begins coughing up a black
bile. She tries to stand, but her legs crumble
away into dust. She makes a pitiful croak and
then falls over into a cloud of sand. When the
cloud settles, no evidence ol her presence
remains.
