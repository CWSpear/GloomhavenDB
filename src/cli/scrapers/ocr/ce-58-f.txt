"There were fifty of them, /
/ *
swear. Tearing my mates apart!
You look over to the bar where a group of
drunkards are all laughing at a disheveled
man in the middle of a story;
"And commanding them all riding atop a giant
armored bear, there was a Vermling with a staff
that shot lightning!0
At this the crowd erupts into more laughter,
drowning out the rest of the mans story
‘ I his man's had too much to drink, I d say
ridicules one ol the crowd. “Vermlings riding
bears! I thought I’d heard of everything!"
Option A: Join the crowd in laughing at the man.
Option B: Calm down the crowd and get more
details from the man about the attack.
