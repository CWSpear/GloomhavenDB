You see smoke on the horizon
and catch the vague stench of burning
flesh. You hasten your step
see
what
catastrophe lies ahead of you on the road
After a few minutes, you come upon a trade caravanr
ravaged by a pack ofVermlings, if the tracks in the
mud are any indication.
Dead bodies and broken, upturned carts lie across
the path„ but you can also see a few survivors,
wounded and bloody on the ground. A woman
limps across the road, carrying pieces of wreckage.
Option A: Help the survivors deal with the
carnage.
Option B: Finish the job the Vernilirtgs started
nd loot whatever is lelt.
