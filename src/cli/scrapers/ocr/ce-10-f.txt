Relaxing for the evening at the
Sleeping Lion, a shifty-looking man
approaches you, hand outstretched. In
it are a pair of pale dice with crude marks
scratched on them.
'Greetings, friends. You look like you could
stand to liven things up a bit. Care for a quick
game of bone dice with me? I'm sure we could
make it interesting." His other hand pats a coin
purse at his side.
Option A: Play a game with the man. It may
prove to be a good time.
Option B: Refuse the
game of dice.
