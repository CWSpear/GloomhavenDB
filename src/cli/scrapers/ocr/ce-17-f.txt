Returning to Gloomhaven with
vour latest haul of' treasure, you
if	r ^
approach the market in search of a
good trade. Unfortunately, there are only
a few visible stands around that are not yet
packing up for the day.
A robed Savvas catches your eye. It has a few
strange artifacts on display, but you approach
with no great expectation, hoping vour goods
will fetch a decent price.
The Savvas silently nods as you approach. It
picks through your haul and lifts up a single
item, holding out a small bag for you in exchange.
Pouring out the bags contents, a single
rectangular black-and white coin lands in vour
palm.
