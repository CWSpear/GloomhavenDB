rou get word from a contact
that there is trouble brewing
down at the East Walls and decide to
investigate.
What you hnd is a large contingency of the
city's Savvas workforce — the best builders
you’ll hnd anywhere in open rebellion
against the construction managers, demanding
better pay for the specialized work they
perform.
'7his city would he a lifeless pile of rocks without
us!*f one of the Savvas yells. “Its time we see
some of its prosperity!”
The manager on the other side of the argument
looks like a captured mouse, not sure at all how
to get out of the situation.
Option A: Talk to the Savvas, appealing to their
sense of duty and community.
Option B: Talk to the managers and attempt to
get the Savvas better pay.
