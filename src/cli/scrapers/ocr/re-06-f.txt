Stumbling through the woods,
you are alarmed to hear the sudden
sounds of a large animal rummaging through
the underbrush Kou crouch down, gauging the
grunts and growls.
Through the trees, you see a large bear approaching
your location. It has not noticed you yet, but you
imagine
it will
soon.
Option A: lake the opportunity to run from the
bear before it gets any closer.
Option B: Attack the bear, hopefully catching it
y surprise.
