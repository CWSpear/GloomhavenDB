A look of horrid surprise flashes in the
Scoundrel's eyes as you leap forward and
throw her to the ground. She doesn’t even
speak as you bind her arms and take her
to the city guard. They thank you for your
service, but their words aren’t much counter
to the cold\ angry stare of the Scoundrel as
she s taken away.
