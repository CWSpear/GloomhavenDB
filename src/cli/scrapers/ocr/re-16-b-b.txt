You are enjoying watching the animals graze
when an arrow flies out and hits the larger of
the deer in its center chest, ft holts away, hut
doesn't make it very far before collapsing.

brush and turn toward you. 7 thought you
were going to do something stupid there for
a second. Thanks for not scaring away my
quarry. Allow me to share some of the spoils
with you,"
All start scenario with BLESS
