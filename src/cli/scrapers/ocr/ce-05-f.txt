After resting for the evening,
you start out your day noticing a
great number of prominent, command-
ing posters around the city.
Reading one, you learn that the Sanctuary of
the Great Oak is laying down the foundation for
a new building on the east side of G/oomhaven.
Everyone is encouraged to come and help. This
could be an important community event.
Option A: Go help lay the foundation.
Option B: Take the opportunity to steal some
valuables in the area while people arc distracted.
