Walking near the northern
gates, you see some commotion as
a group of wounded guards is ushered
into town.
They look pretty bad off. suffering from many
severe wounds. Some even have lost limbs.
Bringing up the rear, one guard is carried in bv
a couple of others. He's missing a leg and has
a vicious looking axe embedded in his side. You
realize that the axe looks kind of familiar.
Option A: Let the guards know you recognize the
Berserker s axe.
Option B: Stay silent and keep out of it.
