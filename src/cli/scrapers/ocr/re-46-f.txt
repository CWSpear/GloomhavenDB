Walking among the foothills,
you see a steep ridge in Iront of you and
on top ol it, a very odd rock formation.
The formation calls to you somehow, but the way up
is not readily apparent. In fact, climbing the ridge
looks pretty dangerous, but you just feel like you
need to get up there and look at the rocks.
Option A: Take the risk to climb tbe ridge and
investigate the rocks*
Option B: Forget about the rocks and continue
n your journey*
