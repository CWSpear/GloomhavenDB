If: The Plagueherald stretches out his arms
and the men around him immediately double
over in pain. You can almost sense it smiling,
even though it doesn't have a face. The fight
doesn't last long, especially once the men's
wounds start bursting with maggots.
All start scenario with 1 damage.
OTHERWISE: The men are weakened, but
they arc still hardened lighters. you light
them off, but it gets ugly.
All start scenario with POISON G
All start scenario with 3 damage.
