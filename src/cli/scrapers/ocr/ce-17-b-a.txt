You slam the strange coin back down onto
the Savvas' display in anger. It reaches out
to grab the coin, but you take hold of ’its arm
and demand a proper payment. Wordlessly,
it looks at you with disdain and throws a
handful of gold in vour face. You shield vour
eyes and move to draw your weapon, hut
when you look around, the Savvas and its
goods are no longer to be found. You sullenly
gather the coins it threw and move on.
Gain 10 collective gold.
