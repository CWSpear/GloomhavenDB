REPUTATION < ~4: You begin to agree with
the Inox that Cloomhaven is a blight on the
land in need of cleansing, and the Inox seems
to believe vou. "Go in peace, then," the leader
says. “A nd stay off my land."
No effect.
OTHERWISE: You try to explain that you
mean the Inox no ill will, but the leader eyes
you skeptically, "foul creature. I curse you
and your kind.' Run — get off my land and
never come back!"
All start scenario with CURSE
