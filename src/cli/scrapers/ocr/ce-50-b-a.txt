HYou grab a bow and start sending arrows
• down into the things thick hide. Each
individual arrow doesn 't do much, but
over time the creature slows. By the time it
manages to break through the gatet it has
been considerably hobbled as black blood
pours from its countless wounds. It charges
forward, laying waste to a small shop, but as
more arrows continue to rain down upon it,
it soon stops and falls over lifeless.
