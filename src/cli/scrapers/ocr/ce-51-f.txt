You are wandering through the
city streets late at night when you
hear a terrifying scream high above
you. >ou look up /ust in time to see a body
falling toward vou and jump out of the way.
It lands with a wet thud on the ground. You
were not the only ones to hear the scream, and
quickly a small crowd forms around the corpse,
including a couple of city guards.
The body is clad in black leather armor, and a
long, thin blade conspicuously protrudes from
its back. You remark that the sword somehow
looks familiar.
“What?" asks a guard. “This is the third murder
like this in a week. Tell me everything vou know! "
Option A: Tell the guard that the sword belongs
to the Nightshroud, your former party member.
Option B: Lie and claim you know nothing.
