The crowd parts as you move toward the
dock with both confidence and care. I he
Lurkers notice your approach and continue to
clack in your direction. You call out to them
and ask why they are here, but all you get in
response is a change in the tempo of their
clacking. When you express conf usion, they
clack again in frustration and scuttle back
into the ocean. The crowd is very impressed
that you managed to ward off the creatures
without using force.
