Riding up on horses, a band
of dirty, rough men quickly overtake
and surround your group. t hey look hard and
dangerous, and you immediately pull out your
weapons as they approach.
Then you hear a familiar laugh.
' Well, if it isn't my old crew." A woman in dark
leather armor leaps off her horse to comes greet
you. 'You know whatt boys? This lot gets a pass.'
She winks at you and turns around. 'Plus, they’d
probably kill you all if things turned ugly:*
Jumping back onto her horse, the Scoundrel looks
back at you. *Well[ it was nice seeing you. Just
remember — you never saw me. *
Option A: Attack. Friend or not, those who prey
on the weak should be brought to justice.
Option B: Let the bandits go.
