After a night of heavy drinking,
you get turned around while
navigating the back alleys and find
yourself standing before a collapsed
section of bricked road that leads down into
an underground tunnel
Fueled by curiosity and a bit of liquid courage,
you descend in search of adventure. Stumbling
around in the vast network of tunnels proves
rather fruitless, however, until a well-concealed
passage leads you to a long-forgot ten stash of
weaponry and dried food.
The stuff could fetch a decent price at the Sunken
Market, or you could turn it over to the city
wt	*
guard, which is always in need arms and rations.
Option A: Sell the goods.
Option B: Donate the goods to the city.
