You head to the Sinking Market,
hoping to find some cheap supplies,
when you are surprised to see a crowd
gathering in the distance. You push your
way through and see a host of dead bodies
in the street, covered in insects and strange
pustules in their skin.
\!earby, a woman screams in terror and runs
away. Other more curious onlookers inch clos-
er, trying to get a better view of the grotesque
scene.
Option A: Help to dispose of the corpses as
quickly as possible.
Option B: Investigate the corpses.
