You walk down the dear path for a few
minutes, and, just when you think the whole
weird feeling was your imagination, a group
of human bandits jumps out at you from
the nearby brush. Before they can engage,
however, an arrow suddenly spears the chest
of the closest bandit, followed very quickly
by a second. The bandits have paused to look
around in panic when a third arrow flies into
another bandit s skull. The bandits scatter
and run off. You look around for the shooter,
but no trace is found.
No effect.
