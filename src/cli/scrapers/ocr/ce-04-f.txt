Having recently returned from
your latest adventure, you are
approached by a ratty-looking boy in
tears.
"Please, sirs, could you please help me with
my cat? He went over there, and I’m afraid."
the boy points a dirty finger at a decrepit,
abandoned building. "I don't know what else
to do."
♦
Option A: Find a cat? You have more important
things to do.
Option B: Reassure the boy and go find the cat.
