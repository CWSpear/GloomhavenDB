You awake in the middle of
the night to the sound of alarms
ringing in the west. You recognize them
as the warning clangs of an attack on the
wall.
Any force hold enough to assault the defenses
of Gloomhaven can't be good, For a moment
you are grateful for the prolific number of
guards defending the city. But still, there is
always the possibility that the guards may not
be enough.
Option A: Go aid in the defense of the city.
Option B: If the guards are distracted by an
attacking force, now would be the perfect time to
steal some valuables.
