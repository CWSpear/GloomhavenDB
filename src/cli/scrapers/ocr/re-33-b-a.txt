; The Acsther in your group leads
you to an area off the road that feels* fuzzy*
It is hard to focus your vision, as if the space
in front of you is only half there. With a few
words from the Aesther, the blur is gone.
No effect.
OTHERWISE: You wander around for a while
before a massive demon suddenly appears
before you, ripped from another plane.
Your presence surprises it, though, and you
dispatch it before too much trouble is causedl
All start scenario with 1 damage.
Discard 1 card each.
