You are attending to business
in the Sinking .Market when a frail
white-haired woman approaches you
and grabs you by the arm,
"Oh my, don't you lot look strong." she says.
"Could you possibly assist me with a small
problem I am having in mv cellar? ”
Her eyes grow narrow. Rats! So many rats! I
don't know where they're coming from, but
they are a right nuisance. Ruined three jars of
preserves just yesterday !
She tugs weakly at vour sleeve. "Please, can you
help me? ”
Option A: Decline to help the old woman.
Option B: Agree to help with the rat infestation.
