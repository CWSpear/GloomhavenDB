Looking for a little bit of
variety, you bead down to the
Brown Door as night falls. After some
wait, you pass through the doors and are
surprised to see the Sawbones sitting near
the back of the room by himself. Considering
this bar is about as seedy and corrupt as they
come, it is just about the last place you would
expect to find him,
"I just...I don't know what to do now," the
Sawbones confesses after you sit down. "Id like
to join the sanctuary and lead a nice, quiet life,
but after adventuring with all of you, that just
doesn't seem fulfilling anymore."
He shakes his head. 7 don't know. This life seems
so boring now. What do you thinkP"
Option A: Tell him that joining the sanctuary is
the right thing to do.
Option B: Tell him to follow his dreams.
