You are rather surprised to
walk into the Brown Door one night
to see your old friend the Soothsinger
playing a song on the corner stage. )bu
are even more surprised when you get closer
and discover the song is about you.
It is a raucous talc about the time she met you
in a forest and you gave her terrible directions
— just the worst, most backward directions
possible.
Everyone in the crowd is tearing up with laughter
as she eloquently describes your bumbling and
ineptitude.
Option A: Embrace the joke and go with it.
Option B: Leave the bar before someone recog-
nizes you.
