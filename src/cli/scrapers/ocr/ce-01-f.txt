You decide to unwind at the
Sleeping Lion, but just as you
arc starting to relay, a bear of a man
crashes into your table, scattering your
drinks across the floor.
Towering over him is a massive Inox. "What
did vou say about my horns? the Inox shouts.
The man stands up and brushes shards ol glass
f rom his tunic. "I said the sight of them makes
me want to vomit!"
The Inox roars and charges headlong into
the man, crashing through more tables in the
process. At this, the entire tavern erupts into
violence. After all, when a man is deep into his
drink, the last thing you want to do is knock that
drink over.
Option A: Join the fray! These insults will not go
unanswered!
Option B: Do your best to stop the fighting. This
is a respectable establishment.
