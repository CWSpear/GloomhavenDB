way to the stairs. Unfortunately, you scrape
your feet against the dirt, and one of the men
turns toward you. He yells out, and you hear
commotion coming from above.
You make a break tor it, bounding up the stairs
into a factory. Men with weapons are running
at you from one direction, so you run the other.:
The factory is a maze, but you do not stop and
eventually find an exit out into the city streets.
You keep running, hoping to lose your pursuers.
Discard 2 cards each.
