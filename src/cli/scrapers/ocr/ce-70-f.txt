ing Market looking for possible
work when you are approached bv a

Sinking Market are in a had way; Our houses are
collapsing, our water is foul\ and we den t even
have enough money for food[
"We are dying here. and the city is doing nothing
to help us. You have friends in high places, right?
Please, there 's gotta he someone you can talk to.

izing the area.
