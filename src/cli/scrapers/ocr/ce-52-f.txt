)ou have been hearing rumors
in the bars: a pox is spreading
through Cioomhaven, affecting lower
class citizens — street urchins and back-
alley thugs.
And then one night you see it: a Narrower
dressed in a ragged green cloak holding a man
do wn in tin alley as its swarm spreads out and
consumes him. The man's screams are muffled
as the insects skitter down his throats
Killing monsters and demons is one thing, but
the Plagueherald shouldn t be preying on people
in the citv. You approach it, intent on stopping
its attack.
Option A: Calmly explain the situation to the
Plagueherald, imploring it to move on.
Option B: Threaten the Plagueherald with
retribution if it doesn’t stop attacking residents.
