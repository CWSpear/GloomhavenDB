You journey out to the Corpsewood, axe
in hand and begin chopping away at the
trees. You seem to have a natural skill with
it, probably due to all the practice you get
swinging a blade. Thanks to your help, the
city is able to gather a large amount of extra
wood for construction. You encounter some
dangers throughout the day but nothing you
cannot handle.
Gain 1 prosperity.
