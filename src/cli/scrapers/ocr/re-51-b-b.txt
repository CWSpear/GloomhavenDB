You remember rumors of an assassins
guild that places a skull on a pike outside
the houses of'their victims before they
strike. Fearing the worst, you pull out your
weapons and survey t he scene as you back
away from the pike. Everything looks clear,
so you quickly get as far away from the area
as possible. Perhaps the skull was not meant
for you.
No effect.
