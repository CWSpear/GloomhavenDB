Despite your best efforts, you
find yourself lost in a forest. You thought
you were taking a shortcut, but then you got
turned around and lost your bearings.
And just when you think things couldn t get worse,
a wolf suddenly jumps out of the brush in front of
you. Oddly; though, it doesn 't appear aggressive.
It howls once and then slowly and deliberately
begins to walk through the trees in front of you, as
if expecting you to follow it.
