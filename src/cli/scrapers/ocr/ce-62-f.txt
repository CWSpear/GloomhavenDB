' So, I hear you stood up for me
with the city guards the other day.
Such annoy ing pests, aren 't they?"
You turn around in the street to see the
Scoundrel emerge from a dark alley with a
smile on her face.
7 just wanted to thank you in person, she says.
7 ve known quite a few persons who would have
ratted me out lor their chance at a piece of gold.
It s good to know some friendships last,
She looks over her shoulder. *Listen, l m leaving
town for a good long while, You wanna grab a
drink before I take off?"
Option A: Have a drink and reminisce about old
times.
Option B: Overpower the Scoundrel and deliver
her to the city guards.
