You pull vour arm away from her filthy grasp
and step away, making apologies for being
too busy. Your excuses lack the proper tact,
however, and soon the woman is bawling in
the street, lamenting that no one will help
her and how the rats will kill her in her sleep,
then feast on her corpse. The whole speech is
very graphic, and passersby begin to give you
odd looks, wondering what you could have
done to upset the poor woman so intensely.
Lose I reputation.
