Confident that the wolves pose no significant
threat, you stand your ground and prepare
for battle, The pack comes — ragged and
hungry slowly emerging from the dark —
and surrounds your party;
There are more of them than you expected[
but not enough to take you down, You suffer
a bite or iwot but arc able to fight them off.
All start scenario with 3 damage.
