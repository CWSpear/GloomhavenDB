The Sinking Market is a
varied area or decrepit huts and
merchants unable to sell their wares
anywhere else. It doesnt surprise you as
you walk through to see a scraggly Vermling
approach with a small sack.
"A potion for the big, strong adventurers! she
savs as she ivjyes you down. “Help you in battle,
it will!"
You are about to push her aside and keep walking
when she pulls the potion out of the sack« It
glows green in the daylight — an impressive,
large flask of master craftsmanship.
“Aha, I knew it catch your eye! How much you
pay?"
Option A: Barter with the Vermling for the
potion.
Option B: Move along. You don't need any more
potions.
