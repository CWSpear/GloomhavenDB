You faugh for a while and trade tales, ,4s the
sun drops below the tavern windows, the
Scoundrel gets up to leave.
"Listen, I really did enjoy our time together,
and, well, I just wanted to leave you with
something to remember me by."
A piece of black cloth flutters down onto the
table. When you look back up, the Scoundrel
is gone.
