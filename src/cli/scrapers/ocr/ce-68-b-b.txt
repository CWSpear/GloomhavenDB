You race out of the inn, trying to minimize
the damage caused by the never-ending
stream of water. Not knowing what else to
do, you head toward the river. Standing on
the banks, you shrug and toss the staff into
the current. You g uess you 'll never know
how the staff ended up where it did or why it
suddenly turned into a faucet.
No effect.
