You arc wandering the Ward of
Seales in the evening when a crowd
of people begins to form outside one of
the shops, growing louder and more dense
hv the second.
/Is you approach, you see a terrified family of
Quatrvls through a familiar angry mob. The
father pleads with a group of disheveled men
with torches.
"C heats! A woman next to you screams, 'Burn
the store down!"
One of the men — clearly not a guard —
backhands the father away from the door and
pushes his way inside the shop.
Option A: Attempt to stop the men from burning
down the shop.
Option B: fake part in the looting and burning
of the store.
